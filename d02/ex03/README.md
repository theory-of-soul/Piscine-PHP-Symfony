Create an Elem class representing an HTML tag. The class should have a constructor with the following parameters:

- element - the name of the HTML tag
- content - the content of the tag (optional)

The class should support the following HTML tags: meta, img, hr, br, html, head,
body, title, h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6, p, span, div.
The class should also contain the pushElement method to add a new element to the tag's contents. A getHTML method should return the HTML code of the tag. If an element / tag contains other elements, the HTML of the sub-elements should also be included.

Example :
 
```php
$elem = new Elem('html');
$body = new Elem('body');
$body->pushElement(new Elem('p', 'Lorem ipsum'));
$elem->pushElement($body);
echo $elem->getHTML();
```

Should generate the following HTML code:
```html
<html>
<body>
    <p>Lorem ipsum</p>
</body>
</html>
```
Modify the TemplateEngine class by adding a constructor that takes an object from the Elem class. The createFile ($ fileName) method should return the HTML generated by the object to a file.
The index.php file should create multiple Elem objects and save the generated content to a file.
