```
Modify the createFile ($ fileName, Text $ text) method of
 the TemplateEngin class to take a Text object as the 
 last parameter.
The Text class should have a constructor that takes an 
array of strings, a method to add new strings, and a 
method to display all strings in HTML, each embedded 
in a <p>.
The createFile method should create a static HTML file 
similar to the one generated in Exercise 00 and whose 
body should include the rendered content of the Text class.
