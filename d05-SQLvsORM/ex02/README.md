By using the previously acquired knowledge, you will need to be able to do other operations from the CRUD package. Let's start with Insert and Read.
This exercise will help you learn to map data from web forms to SQL queries. The expectations of this exercise are as follows:
- Create a bundle for this exercise, named ex02;
- Create a separate table for this exercise using the same structure provided in previous exercises.
- <b>In this exercise you are entitled only to SQL, no ORM authorized;</b>
- Create a Symfony form and a show form action in the controller;
- Create an endpoint for the controller that will manage the data transmitted by the
form ;
- Make sure that single-valued fields will not generate exceptions when inserting;
- Create a web page containing an HTML table in which you will show the contents of the table.

<b>Neither the call to create the table nor the insert should fail if the table already exists or if the data is already present in the table.</b>
